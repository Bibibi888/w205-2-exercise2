In this folder, we have two scripts: finalresults.py and histogram.py.

finalresults.py:

You can either pass in a word to get the count for that word, or you can provide no launch parameters to get a list of all words in the database and their respective counts.

histogram.py:

This script will take in a minimum word count value and maximum word count value and return a list of words which have a count between the provided min and max.

Please pass in a <min>,<max> launch parameter.
